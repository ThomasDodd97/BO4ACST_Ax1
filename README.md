# BO4ACST_Ax1
This repository complements the Bayesian Optimisation for Atmospheric Carbon Sequestering Thermosets (BO4ACST) project being developed at The Materials Science and Metallurgy Department of the University of Cambridge. This repository is the culmination of two year's (or at least it will be...) work on the the optimisation of strength in bio-based thermosets. The accompanying thesis will be published here once this project reaches its conclusion. This is a re-written and updated form of the old repository (BO4ACST) which now is compatible with the latest version of Ax (1.0.0) and supports multi-objective tasks.
